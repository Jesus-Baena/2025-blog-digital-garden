Boiler Room is an online music broadcaster based in London that was founded in 2010 by Blaise Bellville and Thristian Richards. The term "boiler room" may come from the cramped, makeshift office spaces that some companies use, which are often located in the basement or utility room of an existing office building. The "heat" and "pressure" of the close quarters, along with the fast-paced sales tactics, are said to be similar to the conditions in a boiler and its surrounding room. Boiler Room's origin story began when Bellville taped a webcam to the wall of a derelict building and used the space as a studio. The first session was recorded using this webcam and broadcast live online on Ustream. The format of the sessions features DJs facing the camera, with a projected visual backdrop of the Boiler Room logo and old rave video footage. The artists are the main focus, with attendees positioned behind the decks in a bedroom DJ style set-up. The format aims to showcase under-documented local scenes to international listeners, and to support emerging artists and tell stories from the fringes. Boiler Room has built a unique archive of over 8,000 performances by more than 5,000 artists across 200 cities since 2010.
