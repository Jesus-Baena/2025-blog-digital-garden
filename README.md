# Jesus Baena - Digital Garden & Personal Knowledge Management

Welcome to the repository for my personal digital garden. This is a collection of my working notes, thoughts, and technical learnings, published as a static site.

**Live Site:** https://baena.blog

## 🚀 About This Project

This repository serves as my "Second Brain" or Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system. Unlike a polished blog, a digital garden is a space for evolving ideas.

I use this space to document my learning process and work in:
* **Humanitarian Data Analysis:** Information management and data modeling for the humanitarian sector.
* **Tech Stack Learning:** My experiments with **Nuxt, n8n, Flowise**, and **Figma**.
* **Self-Hosting:** Notes on managing server infrastructure and open-source tools.
* **AI & Automation:** Exploring how AI agents can support humanitarian workflows.
