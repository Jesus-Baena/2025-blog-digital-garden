My initial attempt [[From Riga to Andalusia in two wheels]] cut short. The reason was a combination of bad weather and lazyness :)

I drove up to Warsaw and I left the motorbike there. I have to pass through Warsaw from and to my appointment in Ukraine, as there's no flights from the beginning of the full scale invasion, I take the train from Kyiv to Warsaw. So it is actually convenient to have the motorbike there. 

After the winter, I am planning to take a trip over the Balcans.
