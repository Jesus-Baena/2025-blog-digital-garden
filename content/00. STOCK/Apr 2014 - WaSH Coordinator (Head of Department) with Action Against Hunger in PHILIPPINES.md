Deployed to Tacloban in the immediate aftermath of super-typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan). I was **responsible for designing and managing the first-phase emergency** WASH response for Leyte Island, establishing life-saving services for displaced populations in one of the most devastated areas.

- **Launched and managed the initial WASH emergency** response within the first week of the disaster, focusing on IDP camps and heavily damaged coastal areas.
- Designed and **implemented rapid-impact projects** that successfully provided essential water and sanitation services to approximately 84,000 people.
- **Coordinated activities** with other humanitarian actors and local authorities to ensure a coherent and effective response in a chaotic post-disaster environment.
