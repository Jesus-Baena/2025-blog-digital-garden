## **1. Project Title:**  
Project COMPASS: A Generic Field Management Toolkit for Humanitarian NGOs
    
## **2. Implementing Organization (Placeholder):**  
CrisisCompanion is a task-based consultancy specialized in humanitarian operations support through data analysis, business processes, web technology and AI. Currently this venture is a soloprenour by an experienced field humanitarian expert. 

## **3. Project Background & Problem Statement:**  
Humanitarian crises demand rapid, efficient, and accountable responses. However, many Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), particularly new, small, or local ones, face significant challenges in establishing field operations quickly and effectively. They often lack standardized, easy-to-use, and affordable tools for core functions like administration, logistics, program management, and security. This can lead to:

- Delayed start-up times and slower delivery of aid.
- Inefficient use of limited resources (time, money, personnel).
- Difficulties in maintaining compliance and accountability to donors and beneficiaries.
- Increased operational risks due to ad-hoc systems.
- A steep learning curve for new field staff.
- Duplication of effort as multiple organizations develop similar internal tools.

Existing commercial software solutions can be expensive, overly complex, require extensive customization, or lack crucial offline capabilities essential in many field contexts. There is a clear need for a generic, adaptable, and user-friendly toolkit designed specifically for the realities of humanitarian field operations.

This project **capitalizes on the** experience and **accumulated** resources **of** CrisisCompanion.

## **4. Project Goal:**  
To enhance the operational efficiency, accountability, and effectiveness of humanitarian NGOs, particularly during field start-up and ongoing operations, by providing a generic, adaptable, and user-friendly Field Management Toolkit (dashboard).

## **5. Project Objectives:**

- **Objective 1:** To design and develop a modular, web-based (with strong offline capabilities) Field Management Toolkit ("NGO Dashboard") covering core operational areas: Administration, Logistics, Programs, Security, and Communication/Reporting.
    
- **Objective 2:** To populate the toolkit with essential templates, S.O.Ps, checklists, and simplified tracking tools relevant for initial field deployment and basic ongoing management.
    
- **Objective 3:** To develop comprehensive user guides, training materials, and a support mechanism for NGOs adopting the toolkit.
    
- **Objective 4:** To promote the adoption of the toolkit within the wider humanitarian community as a free or low-cost resource.
    
## **6. Target Beneficiaries:**

- **Direct Beneficiaries:** Humanitarian NGOs (international, national, and local), particularly those with limited resources or newly establishing field presences. Field staff (managers, coordinators, officers) across various departments.
    
- **Indirect Beneficiaries:** Crisis-affected populations who will benefit from more rapid, efficient, and accountable humanitarian assistance delivered by NGOs using the toolkit.
    

## **7. Expected Outcomes & Deliverables:**

- A fully functional, open-source (or affordably licensed) Field Management Toolkit (NGO Dashboard) available for download/access.
- A comprehensive library of practical templates, SOPs, and guides integrated within the toolkit.
- Improved operational setup speed for NGOs deploying to new emergencies.
- Enhanced consistency and standardization in core administrative, logistical, and programmatic processes.
- Increased capacity of NGO staff in field management.
- Better data management, leading to improved internal and external reporting.
- A community of users providing ongoing feedback for future development.
- Training materials and user guides freely available.


## **8. Sustainability:**  
The toolkit is envisioned as a resource for the humanitarian community. Sustainability options include:

- Releasing it as an open-source project to encourage community contributions and adaptations.
- Seeking partnerships with larger INGOs or UN agencies for long-term hosting and maintenance.
- A potential "freemium" model where the basic toolkit is free, with optional paid support or advanced modules in the future (if appropriate).
- Grant funding for ongoing maintenance and feature development.
