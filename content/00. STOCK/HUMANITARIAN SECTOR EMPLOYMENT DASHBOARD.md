## **1. Project Title:** **Humanitarian Jobs Dashboard 2025 - 2026:** 
A real-time business intelligence dashboard processing millions of data points daily to provide actionable insights for enterprise clients.

## **2. Implementing Organization (Placeholder):** 
This is a personal project. 

## **3. Project Background & Problem Statement:**
The year 2025 has been marked by a "Great Contraction" in the humanitarian sector, triggered by massive funding freezes from major donor countries. This crisis has accelerated a trend of "precarity," where stable, long-term positions are being replaced by short-term, "gig-based" consultancy roles. This structural shift threatens institutional memory and aid quality.

Currently, there is a lack of real-time monitoring tools to track these workforce dynamics. Standard analysis often misses the "missing middle"—the high attrition rate of professionals in their mid-30s—and the increasing "emotional and physical weight" of the profession. A data-driven approach is needed to provide a "rolling" view of these market shifts.

## **4. Project Goal:**
To build a sovereign, AI-powered intelligence platform that monitors the ReliefWeb API to analyze the impact of the 2025 funding crisis on humanitarian workforce stability, localization trends, and technical skill requirements.

## **5. Project Objectives:**

- **Automated Market Monitoring:** Deploy n8n workflows to ingest daily job data, specifically tracking the ratio of consultancy vs. full-time roles to monitor sector precarity.
    
- **AI-Driven Extraction:** Leverage Flowise (LLM extraction) to read job descriptions and determine "Localization" status (local vs. international) and hidden technical requirements (SQL, KoboToolbox, PowerBI).
    
- **Trend Stabilization:** Implement SQL-based "rolling seven-day totals" to eliminate analytical noise from calendar cutoffs, ensuring an honest representation of market downturns.
    
- **Self-Hosted Visualization:** Utilize a containerized Metabase instance to serve high-density, interactive dashboards directly to stakeholders via a Nuxt frontend.
    

## **6. Target Beneficiaries:**

- **Humanitarian Professionals:** To help them navigate a shrinking market by identifying resilient consultancy niches and required technical skills.
    
- **Sector Researchers & NGOs:** To provide data on "brain drain" and the effectiveness of localization efforts during funding crises.
    
- **Policy Makers:** To visualize the secondary, sector-wide workforce impact resulting from high-level funding stops.
    

## **7. Expected Outcomes & Deliverables:**

- **Live Intelligence Dashboard:** A Metabase-powered UI displaying real-time job trends, hiring heatmaps, and contract-type distributions.
    
- **Localization Report:** Data insights generated by AI extraction confirming the stability (or lack thereof) in local hiring compared to international roles.
    
- **Open-Source Pipeline:** Publicly available GitHub repository containing the SQL queries and n8n automation flows used to power the dashboard.
    
- **Technical Documentation:** A "beginner-friendly" guide on deploying this stack (n8n, Flowise, Metabase, Nuxt) using Docker.
