Following over a decade in high-intensity emergency response, **I undertook a strategic sabbatical focused on reflection and targeted professional development.** This period was dedicated to deepening my understanding of humanitarian complexities through academic study and acquiring new technical skills in data science to drive more impactful, evidence-based interventions.

- Engaged in strategic **career reflection** and professional goal-setting after 11 years in demanding frontline and leadership roles.
- Pursued advanced academic studies to **deepen theoretical knowledge** of humanitarian principles and complex emergencies.
- Completed intensive **training in data science** and analytics to leverage data for improving the efficiency and impact of future humanitarian efforts.
