I previously experimented with Arch Linux via Manjaro, but frequent roadblocks and a lack of ArcGIS compatibility eventually forced a return to other systems. However, with AI now available to help troubleshoot technical hurdles—combined with the streamlined elegance of [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/)—**I’ve fully embraced the Arch ecosystem once again**.

It has also been a journey of commitment. Since my first attempt at Arch, I’ve completely replaced ESRI with QGIS, GeoServer, and R. My only remaining ties to Windows are Power BI and the occasional Excel task, which I now manage through Virtual Machine Manager. Freeing myself from proprietary GIS software.

While I love the Omarchy vibe, the recurring bloat after updates is not a minor hurdle. And the excessive reliance in *webapps*, and the constant breaks after updates shows that a script goes only as far as this. 

In a perfect world, I’d port this entire setup to a minimal [[Debian]]/Wayland environment, keeping the beautiful themes and terminal tools while ditching the unnecessary defaults. For now, I'll pay the 'Omakase price' until I can find the time to build my own custom Debian spin.
