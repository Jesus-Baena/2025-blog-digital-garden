#### 1. The Foundation of Autonomy and Strategic Purchasing

- **Law of Ukraine No. 2168-VIII "On State Financial Guarantees of Medical Care for the Population" (2017):** This is the core legislative act that initiated the "money follows the patient" principle. It required healthcare facilities to undergo **"autonomization,"** changing their legal status from budget institutions to CNPEs so they could sign contracts with the National Health Service of Ukraine (NHSU).

- **Law of Ukraine No. 2009-VIII (The "Autonomization Law"):** This specifically amended the **"Fundamentals of the Legislation of Ukraine on Healthcare"** to allow for the reorganization of state and communal healthcare facilities into non-profit enterprises.


#### 2. Network Structure and Classification

- **Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 174 "On Certain Issues of the Organization of the Capable Network of Healthcare Facilities" (2023):** This document formalizes the **"Capable Network" (Spromozhna Merezha)**. It establishes the functional hierarchy of **General**, **Cluster**, and **Super-Cluster** hospitals and sets the mandatory clinical and diagnostic requirements for each tier.

- **Resolution No. 754 (June 2025 Amendments):** Recent updates to various resolutions focused on refining the structure and functioning of medical advisory commissions and improving care for rare diseases within the capable network.


#### 3. Financial and Operational Regulation

- **Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 1503 (December 2024):** Entitled "Some issues of implementing the program of state guarantees of medical care for the population in 2025," this resolution defines the mechanism, tariffs, and **Program of Medical Guarantees (PMG)** for the 2025 fiscal year.

- **Tax Code of Ukraine (Article 133.4):** Regulates the criteria for a CNPE to maintain its **non-profit status**, ensuring that any surplus funds are reinvested into the facility’s development or social services rather than distributed as profit.


#### 4. Governance and Management

- **Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 1077:** Regulates the formation of **Supervisory Boards** in communal healthcare facilities. It mandates these boards for larger hospitals to ensure community accountability and transparent oversight of the General Director.

- **MoH Order No. 1977:** Introduced the separation of administrative and clinical leadership, legally bifurcating the traditional "Chief Physician" role into a **General Director (CEO)** and a **Medical Director**.


#### 5. Humanitarian Framework (UHF Context)

- **CBPF Global Guidelines (Updated Dec 2022):** While not a Ukrainian law, this is the "constitution" for the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF). It outlines the minimum global standards for partner eligibility, risk management, and the **Partner Capacity Assessment (PCA)** required for any entity, including local ones, to receive direct funding.
