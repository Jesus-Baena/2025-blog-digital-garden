# The mistake of not considering Local Health facilities as part of localization targets. 

The Ukrainian response is becoming the global benchmark for **localization**. In 2024, the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF) achieved a historic milestone, with nearly **60% of funding directed to local partners**. However, while national NGOs have become the backbone of the response, the medical infrastructure remains largely trapped in an "intermediary" model.

It is time to recognize that Ukraine’s healthcare facilities are no longer the centralized, rigid state organs of the past. Through years of reform, they have evolved into the exact kind of autonomous, resilient partners the humanitarian system claims to seek.

## The Autonomy Revolution: Meet the CNPE

The fundamental argument for direct partnership lies in the legal transformation of these facilities into **Communal Non-Profit Enterprises (CNPEs)**. This isn't just a name change; it’s a structural revolution:

- **Financial Independence:** Unlike old budgetary institutions, a CNPE manages its own accounts outside the State Treasury. This allows them to retain funds for reinvestment and manage humanitarian grants with the fiduciary independence required by international donors.

- **Managerial Freedom:** General Directors now have the authority to optimize staffing and internal structures based on actual demand—a critical capability when responding to the shifting needs of a war zone.
    
    +1
    
- **Corporate Governance:** The bifurcation of leadership into a **General Director (CEO)** for business management and a **Medical Director** for clinical quality mimics modern corporate standards.

## The Transparency of the "Unified Medical Space"

A common hesitation for Country-Based Pooled Funds (CBPFs) is the risk of aid diversion within state systems. However, Ukraine’s **eHealth (EHCS)** infrastructure provides a level of digital oversight that exceeds many international NGOs.

- **Digital Truth:** Every service, referral, and patient interaction is recorded in a central database, ensuring the "money follows the patient".
    
- **Accountability:** The mandate for **Supervisory Boards**—comprising local council reps, NGOs, and independent experts—adds a layer of community oversight that prevents political interference.
    

## Breaking the Intermediary Cycle

Currently, humanitarian aid often reaches hospitals through a "firewall" of UN agencies or International NGOs. While this ensures compliance, it adds layers of overhead and slows down the response.

If a **Cluster Hospital** is already vetted by the National Health Service of Ukraine (NHSU) to handle complex stroke care or specialized rehabilitation, it possesses the institutional maturity to be a direct partner of the UHF. By treating CNPEs as **"Public-Humanitarian Partners,"** the UHF could:

+1

1. **Reduce overhead costs** that are currently lost in multi-tier sub-granting.
    
2. **Strengthen local systems** directly, rather than building parallel humanitarian supply chains.
    
3. **Ensure sustainability**, as these facilities are permanent fixtures of the community.

## A Special Situation Demands Special Modalities

The "Capable Network" (Spromozhna Merezha) has already done the hard work of identifying which hospitals are equipped to handle the most critical loads. From **Super-Cluster** regional hubs to **General Hospitals** serving smaller districts, the hierarchy is clear.

The humanitarian community often speaks about "working ourselves out of a job." In Ukraine, the job is being done by CNPEs every day under fire. It is time for our financing mechanisms to catch up to the reality of Ukrainian resilience.
