# The Oversight of Excluding Local Health Facilities from Localization Targets

The Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF) recently achieved a historic milestone, with nearly **60% of funding directed to local partners**. In almost any other emergency, I would celebrate this success; however, in the case of Ukraine, it represents a missed opportunity to directly support local health facilities.

The fundamental comparative advantage of this type of funding is typically to support local NGOs from civil society rather than governmental entities. Yet, by applying a *"blanket approach"* to all sectors, we have missed a critical nuance. In the specific case of the health sector—and within the context of an ambitious reform seeking deep decentralization—this exclusion is increasingly unfitting.

Under the current reform, Ukrainian health facilities have transitioned into **Communal Non-Profit Enterprises (CNPEs)**. These are not rigid state organs; they are autonomous, community-owned entities with their own financial management and managerial freedom.

Insisting on supporting only traditional local NGOs, regardless of the context, relegates humanitarian health assistance to the periphery of the population's actual needs. This creates a situation where specialized medical NGOs are essentially coerced into tailoring their programming to meet "localization" requirements. Often, this forces them to provide services that move away from direct clinical assistance—which is already led by the local health facilities—and tilt into general protection services.

## Meet the Community Non-Profit Enterprises (CNPE)

The fundamental argument for direct partnership lies in the legal transformation of these facilities into **Communal Non-Profit Enterprises (CNPEs)**. This isn't just a name change; it’s a structural twist:

- **Financial Independence:** Unlike old budgetary institutions, a CNPE manages its own accounts outside the State Treasury. This allows them to retain funds for reinvestment and manage humanitarian grants with the fiduciary independence required by international donors.

- **Managerial Freedom:** General Directors now have the authority to optimize staffing and internal structures based on actual demand—a critical capability when responding to the shifting needs of a war zone.

- **Corporate Governance:** The bifurcation of leadership into a **General Director (CEO)** for business management and a **Medical Director** for clinical quality mimics modern corporate standards.


## The Transparency of the "Unified Medical Space"

A common hesitation for Country-Based Pooled Funds (CBPFs) is the risk of aid diversion within state systems. However, Ukraine’s **eHealth (EHCS)** infrastructure provides a level of digital oversight that exceeds many international NGOs.

- **Digital Truth:** Every service, referral, and patient interaction is recorded in a central database, ensuring the "money follows the patient".

- **Accountability:** The mandate for **Supervisory Boards**—comprising local council reps, NGOs, and independent experts—adds a layer of community oversight that prevents political interference.


## A Special Situation Demands Special Modalities

The "Capable Network" (Spromozhna Merezha) has already done the hard work of identifying which hospitals are equipped to handle the most critical loads. From **Super-Cluster** regional hubs to **General Hospitals** serving smaller districts, the hierarchy is clear.

The humanitarian community often speaks about *"working ourselves out of a job."* In Ukraine, the job is being done by CNPEs every day, and yet we prefer to prioritize to fund some organizations that (sometimes) have little track on their own existance.

## The legal context of these claims, can be traced here: 

#### 1. The Foundation of Autonomy and Strategic Purchasing

- **Law of Ukraine No. 2168-VIII "On State Financial Guarantees of Medical Care for the Population" (2017):** This is the core legislative act that initiated the "money follows the patient" principle. It required healthcare facilities to undergo **"autonomization,"** changing their legal status from budget institutions to CNPEs so they could sign contracts with the National Health Service of Ukraine (NHSU).

- **Law of Ukraine No. 2009-VIII (The "Autonomization Law"):** This specifically amended the **"Fundamentals of the Legislation of Ukraine on Healthcare"** to allow for the reorganization of state and communal healthcare facilities into non-profit enterprises.


#### 2. Network Structure and Classification

- **Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 174 "On Certain Issues of the Organization of the Capable Network of Healthcare Facilities" (2023):** This document formalizes the **"Capable Network" (Spromozhna Merezha)**. It establishes the functional hierarchy of **General**, **Cluster**, and **Super-Cluster** hospitals and sets the mandatory clinical and diagnostic requirements for each tier.

- **Resolution No. 754 (June 2025 Amendments):** Recent updates to various resolutions focused on refining the structure and functioning of medical advisory commissions and improving care for rare diseases within the capable network.


#### 3. Financial and Operational Regulation

- **Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 1503 (December 2024):** Entitled "Some issues of implementing the program of state guarantees of medical care for the population in 2025," this resolution defines the mechanism, tariffs, and **Program of Medical Guarantees (PMG)** for the 2025 fiscal year.

- **Tax Code of Ukraine (Article 133.4):** Regulates the criteria for a CNPE to maintain its **non-profit status**, ensuring that any surplus funds are reinvested into the facility’s development or social services rather than distributed as profit.


#### 4. Governance and Management

- **Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 1077:** Regulates the formation of **Supervisory Boards** in communal healthcare facilities. It mandates these boards for larger hospitals to ensure community accountability and transparent oversight of the General Director.

- **MoH Order No. 1977:** Introduced the separation of administrative and clinical leadership, legally bifurcating the traditional "Chief Physician" role into a **General Director (CEO)** and a **Medical Director**.


#### 5. Humanitarian Framework (UHF Context)

- **CBPF Global Guidelines (Updated Dec 2022):** While not a Ukrainian law, this is the "constitution" for the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF). It outlines the minimum global standards for partner eligibility, risk management, and the **Partner Capacity Assessment (PCA)** required for any entity, including local ones, to receive direct funding.
