# **[[HUMANITARIAN AI AGENT CHAT]]**

The goal was **to launch an open-access AI chat application** that any visitor can use immediately, while offering an optional registration path for users who wish to save and manage their conversation history.

# **[[FIELD MANAGEMENT KIT]]**

The Field Management Kit is **a curated collection of practical tools for field management and coordination.** It is a living project, where I adapt and refine solutions developed over fourteen years of my own field work, making them accessible for broader use. My goal is to help others benefit from this experience so they don't have to reinvent the wheel.

# **[[HUMANITARIAN JOBS DASHBOARD]]**

The Humanitarian Sector Employment Dashboard is a Business Intelligence Demo designed **to provide a dynamic and near real-time overview** of the hiring landscape within the aid community in the form of an interactive dashboard.
