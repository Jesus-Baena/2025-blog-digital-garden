This section provides updates on the technology I use. It is organized into two categories: **Local-First**, an inventory of my physical infrastructure; and **Open-Source-First**, a list of the software I host or utilize.

These are two principles I aim to achieve. To that end, I have been building on-site infrastructure to gain independence and sovereignty over my data, as well as the data of my collaborators and clients. This is why, among other actions, [[I moved to create my own Docker Swarm]].
