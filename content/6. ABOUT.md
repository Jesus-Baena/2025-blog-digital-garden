**Hello, I'm Jesus Baena.** I have been working as a humanitarian since 2010, and this blog and Digital Garden is where I share my more personal writing and ideas.

While this space is personal, my professional portfolio, with finished articles and demos, is at [baena.ai](https://baena.ai). For a comprehensive overview of my career, please visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/jbaenanet). If you're interested in the technical side of my work, you can find my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Jesus-Baena) and my data projects on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessbaena).
